## Installation
        
1.) Download this repository to your local device by cloning it or some other method. You will want the folder titled "Cosmo X ...". 

a.) **IF the folder is already in .sb3 format**, then you are welcome to create a shortcut to the file itself and move it somewhere desirable or move the .sb3 file somewhere else.

b.) **IF the folder is in .zip format**. All you need to do is rename the extension from ".zip" to ".sb3" For example: "cosmo-x.zip" to "cosmo-x.sb3". Then follow step a.

c.) **IF the folder is NOT in .zip format and NOT in .sb3 format**, then ZIP the "Cosmo X..." folder using a 3rd-party software, then follow step b, then step a.

2.) You are done! You may now open the file to play it using Scratch Offline Editor, Turbowarp, or another .sb3 file reading program. 
        
## Usage
        
Because this is a Sonic fan-game, it is respectful to not make money off of Sega's licensed characters without their written approval.

## License
        
This project follows the MIT license. Because this game uses licensed characters, this game probably should not make money.
